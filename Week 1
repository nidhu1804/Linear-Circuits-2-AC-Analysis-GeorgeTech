Which of the following are true concerning phasors? Check all that apply.


Phasors must have the same amplitude in order to add them.


The phase, \thetaθ, of a phasor cannot be equal to zero.


When multiplying 2 phasors in rectangular form, a +jb a+jb and c + jdc+jd, the product will equal (a * b) + j(c * d)(a∗b)+j(c∗d).


When adding 2 phasors in rectangular form, a +jba+jb and c + jdc+jd, the sum will equal (a + b) + j(c + d)(a+b)+j(c+d).


Phasors must have the same frequency in order to add them.
